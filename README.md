# Lua host
This is an WIP lua host for rds spy, a plugin

Compile this under MINGW32, not 64, RDS Spy lives in the past where men who couldn't count to 4294967296 in a CPU word still walked the planet

Project started 1st of January, 2026

Aside from all that, this loads and executes the script at "%LOCALAPPDATA%\RDS Spy\script.lua", with the api in the `plugin.lua` meta-file

## Why?

Ask Jan Kolar why his funny little rds decoder doesn't have Enchanced RT (excluding the 0x6552 to ERT mapping of course). Yes, no eRT decoding is really why is this, because why decode RDS in C (or even delphi ughhh) when you can just do it in lua!

Also RDS Surveyor doesn't take line-in MPX input

# Scripts

Inside of the examples folder you have `basic.lua` which mostly replaces the `basic.dll` plugin in RDS Spy

I have also included `large_pi.lua`, while `basic.lua` already shows the PS and PI on a large font, this does only the large PI and PS but in a even larger font. event 1 toggles stickyness

# Console

You have a console window generated by this plugin which has as of now 8 buttons where the first if you double-click the "Reload" button, I don't know what it does but maybe it reloads the script?

The other 7 send events to the Lua script, you can use this with the console mode:true to display diffrent "menus" on the console, double clicking also sends a unique event
