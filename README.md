# Lua host
This is an WIP lua host for rds spy, a plugin

Compile this under MINGW32, not 64, RDS Spy lives in the past where men who couldn't count to 4294967295 still walked the planet

Project stared 1st of January, 2026 (or 7 haha)

Aside from all that, this it loads and executes the script at "%LOCALAPPDATA%\RDS Spy\script.lua", with the api in the `plugin.lua` meta-file

## Why?

Ask Jan Kolar why his funny little rds decoder doesn't have Enchanced RT (excluding the 0x6552 to ERT mapping of course)
